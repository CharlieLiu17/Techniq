# Techniq

Techniq is an automatic athlete analysis app that can be used for virtually every physical sport. Techniq takes professional footage the user inputs (i.e. Steph Curry shooting a basketball) and also takes the user's own footage (i.e. themself shooting the basketball). Techniq can sync the two footages down to the frame, and will then give you frame by frame comparison of the user's form against the professional. Techniq will give differences in form in degrees for all parts of the body.

## Who is this for?

Techniq should be used by athletes and coaches alike for form training.

Athletes can never always be under the watchful eye of a coach. And whil this app obviously can't completely replicate a coach, it can be a pivotal tool speeden the learning feedback loop for the athlete.

Coaches can also greatly benefit from this. An athlete and a coach have limited time together, and that time is wasted if the two of them stand around for the coach to manually sync the videos. Additionally, the app may even spot faults in form that even the coach could not detect in real-time.

## Why did we make Techniq?

Techniq was a product of a HackGT8, by Team STAC. STAC was composed of Charlie Liu, Amal Chaudry, Tina Nguyen, and Sheza Chaudry
